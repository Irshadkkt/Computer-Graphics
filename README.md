# Computer-Graphics
Contains various computer graphics projects, including implementations of transformations, rendering algorithms, and visualization techniques.

README Description for 2D Transformations in Computer Graphics
2D Transformations in C++ using Graphics.h
This project demonstrates 2D transformations in computer graphics using C++ and the Turbo C++ graphics library (graphics.h). The program applies various transformations to a rectangle, including:

Translation (Shifting the object in x and y directions)

Rotation (Rotating the object around the origin)

Scaling (Changing the size of the object)

Shearing (Skewing the shape along the x or y axis)

Features
Visualizes each transformation step-by-step in different colors.

Uses basic matrix multiplication for transformations.

Draws coordinate axes to provide reference.

Requirements
Turbo C++ / Borland C++ (for graphics.h)

Windows OS (since graphics.h is outdated and not supported on Linux/macOS)

How to Run
Install Turbo C++ and set up the graphics library.

Compile and run the program in Turbo C++.

The output window will show a rectangle undergoing transformations.

Improvements & Future Work
Implement transformations using modern graphics libraries like OpenGL, SDL, or SFML.

Add user interaction (e.g., input transformation values at runtime).

Use object-oriented programming (OOP) for better structure.
